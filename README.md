Coffee Shop Code Challenge
Description
This project models a simple Coffee Shop domain with three main classes: Customer, Coffee, and Order. The goal is to manage customers, coffees, and orders, keeping track of which customers order which coffees, and how much they pay for each order. The application ensures data validation for prices and customer information and allows for managing customer orders.

Features
Customer: Represents a customer with a name. Validates that the name is between 1 and 15 characters.
Coffee: Represents a coffee type. Stores the name of the coffee.
Order: Represents an order placed by a customer for a specific coffee at a given price. Tracks all orders and ensures the price is between $1.00 and $10.00.
